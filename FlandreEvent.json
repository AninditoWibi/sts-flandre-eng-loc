      "Navigating an unlit street, you come across several hooded figures in the midst of some dark ritual. As you approach, they turn to you in eerie unison.

      "You exert a tiny bit of your power, just enough to establish an aura of ~domination~. NL The hooded figures step back in awe, realizing the true #ysignificance of the #rnoble #rvampire before them.",
      "The tall figure kneels before you in reverence, and so do the hooded figures around you. NL NL ~Shivering~, he produces a gilded vial and offers it to you. NL ~Noble~ ~vampiress~, ~we~ ~bow~ ~down~ ~to~ ~your~ ~power~. ~Please~ ~accept~ ~our~ ~treasured~ ~offerings~ ~to~ ~you~.",
      "With a #rdisdainful look on your face, you accept the #goffering. The entire group then morphs into a thick black fog that flows away from you. NL You are alone once more."
